# set creation for Deep Learning (C++)

Before reading: this is my first repo and i'm quite new in programming so be comprehensive.

## Goal
-from the zip file data face, create set of image file ready for deep learning 

### How it work
-more than 7000 face image in the zip file, around 350 differents peoples.
-the first code "rangement photo" create on folder by person and put all the image of this person inside (based on the image name).
-the second code "categorisation photo" has two mode cat and set
      -cat will open one image of each people and allow you to give some criteria (like if he has glasses or men/women)
      -set will create folder for deep learning based on one criteria with a learning set and a validation set.
